# HarVara 
# Best AgriTech Hack @ Harvest Hacks by Major Hacking League
## Inspiration
My inspiration was to join Green Revolution as a part of save soil campaign held in India, which talked about infertility in soil and that our food is less nutritional than 100 years ago.

## What it does
I decided to be a part of the campaign by creating a website that provides a digital solution to the unawareness about quality fertilizers specific to crops. I have built a range slider and an image slider in combination to create a system that generates specific fertilizers based on quality, type of use, and certain specifics. For example, for wheat, the most natural and healthy fertilizer is rotten farm manure, but a more effective is nitrogen fertilizer. And this information is presented through the range slider. Also, I have followed the trend of putting a dark mode changer.

## How we built it
I built it using HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into
I ran into challenges when coding the range sliders because their application on this website is quite unique.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of building a website that advocates for a global cause and hopes to improve the current farming practices for the survival of future generations.

## What we learned
I learned how to create a range slider and an image slider function together, in coherence.

## What's next for Harvara
I am thinking about to add more things to find and order like tools, machines, soils so that farmers can purchase at best price and also to get daily market crops rate to sell them.
