            <h1>About us</h1>
             
			<h3> Welcome to “HarVara” family, we are one of our very first kinds. </h3>
			
			<p>We are a band of students who care about the agricultural sector of the world including one of its biggest aspects the farmers. 
			Via statistics and mere observation, we found out that farmers over fertilize their lands with an expectation to grow crops more efficiently, 
			but this is only achieved for some of the few cycles of crops grown like this. After a while the land loses its nitrous reserves and then becomes barren. </p>

			<p> <b>Our mission</b>: To aware the next generation of farmers about the harmful impact of chemical fertilizers, and to provide alternatives to them.</p>
			
			<h3><b>What makes our website unique?</b></h3>
			<p>-Well firstly, we stand for a global issue which is soil across the world losing its fertility, we provide informatics and logistics on how we can overcome this probable situation.</p>
			
			
          
              <h3> <b> Digital Solution</b></h3>
           
            <p>
                We have researched and compiled data to create a "range slider" that can help farmers to decide
				which type of fertilizer is best for a certain crop in which amount considering their size of land.
			</p>

			Click the 'fertilizers' text at the top right of the website to access the range slider.

            <h2>What are fertlizers?</h2>
            <p>Fertilizer, natural or artificial substance containing the chemical elements that improve growth and productiveness of plants. 
			   Fertilizers enhance the natural fertility of the soil or replace chemical elements taken from the soil by previous crops.

            </p>
            <p>
               Soil fertility is the quality of a soil that enables it to provide compounds in adequate amounts and
                proper balance to promote growth of plants when other factors (such as light, moisture, temperature, and
                soil structure) are favourable. Where fertility of the soil is not good, natural or manufactured
                materials may be added to supply the needed plant nutrients. These are called fertilizers, although the
                term is generally applied to largely inorganic materials other than lime or gypsum.
            </p>
            <p>
                In total, plants need at least 16 elements, of which the most important are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
                nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Plants obtain carbon from the
                atmosphere and hydrogen and oxygen from water; other nutrients are taken up from the soil. Although
                plants contain sodium, iodine, and cobalt, these are apparently not essential. This is also true of
                silicon and aluminum.
